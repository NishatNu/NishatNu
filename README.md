Hi, I'm Nishat, I have a passion for data. I am a numbers person. Spreadsheets and data make sense to me. I welcome the challenge of translating data into understandable information. I have extensive background as a data analyst. Along with harvesting data, I have also used data to tell stories. I do not just gather information. As a data storyteller, I have harnessed the power of data to tell compelling stories and help organizations solve problems, improve processes, and plan its next steps for business. I also enjoyed undertaking Kaggle competitions in my free time.
